# Deterministic-Chaos
Some personal projects concerning deterministic chaos and its implications

Menger_sponge - Plotting the famous Menger Sponge using plotly into .html file

Lorenz_system - Plotting the Rossler and Lorenz systems in matplotlib to either show the divergence of initially close point or just iterating the system from one point.  Can also calculate the largest Lyapunov exponent of the Lorenz system. 

deterministic_Chaos - Full overview of the course on Deterministic Chaos. 

Sierpinski_Triangle - Draws a simple demonstration of the Sierpinski Triangle - data is generated by a modified version of the Chaos Game. 

Cobweb_Plot - Draws an animation of the cobweb plot of an arbitrary function based on varying values of initial x value.
