# Deterministic-Chaos
Some personal projects concerning deterministic chaos and its implications

Menger_sponge - Plotting the famous Menger Sponge using plotly into .html file

Lorenz_system - Plotting the Rossler and Lorenz systems in matplotlib to either show the divergence of initially close point or just iterating the system from one point.  Can also calculate the largest Lyapunov exponent of the Lorenz system.
